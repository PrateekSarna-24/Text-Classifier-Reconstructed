# Text-Classifier-Reconstructed
Reconstructed the Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes Classifier for Text Classification.

The given input text had to be classified under a category. The dataset used was 20 news groups

The Dataset was converted into a vectorized form manually. Top 'K' words were used as features. They were selected on the basis of their frequency.

The process of selecting the words was simple, that is, to choose top frequency words after Removing Stop Words,  Lemmatizing or Stemming the words. Lemmatizing was done by identifying the Part of Speech of the Word.
